## notes from his lecture:

- music culture as a symptom of temporal pathology/malaise
- waning of historicity and the experience of time itself
- bad news: the future has disappeared
- 21st cent = 20th cent culture on HD screens and via high speed internet
- specificity of culture belonging to time period has been lost
- excessive tolerance for the archaic
- we don’t expect music now to sound like a radical break from the past, we expect it to be a subtle remodulation that is available to only aficionados
- time as marked by music !!!!!
- there is no criteria for obsolescence in culture
- 21st cent developments in music have not been good for musicians; key technological shifts have been to do with consumption and distribution
- emergence of the internet neatly coincides with the disappearance of the future
- with the weight of the past so easily available, it makes it harder for the new to emerge (partially true, not enough to explain everything)
- smartphones are portals into cyberspace that we carry around with us at all times // which induces habituated reflexes which we have to make a deliberate effort to step outside of
- deleuze describes communication as a command; our smartphones are essentially commanding us everyday; our nervous systems are being strained by it
- the role of art schools: space for popular modernism; experimental techniques, methodologies, preoccupations were disseminated/extended, furthered and popularised via music
- music was a portal into a whole set of cultural resources
- ^the possibility of modernism has closed down^
- “no one is bored. everything is boring”
- we are distracted from our own boredom, distracted from the boring nature of things as we are always subject to these (tethered to the cyberspace) idiotic compulsions
- anxiety has replaced boredom
- domination of capitalism over culture = permanently fragmented attention and dispersion VS a sense of time which is unpressured, expansive which is fugitive at the moment
- the criticism of nostalgia is overrated
- the problem we’ve got is overrating the present and underrating our own dissatisfaction with it!!!
- politicised melancholia = a refusal to adjust to the present moment
- politicised melancholia vs naturalised depression (which is complete acceptance with the state of the present or bargaining)
- a refusal of the present which is not really present, a refusal of the failure of the future
