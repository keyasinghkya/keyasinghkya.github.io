## notes from rohail's presentation:

- starts by talking about sound as a physical presence
- connecting it to senses / how they occur and manifest x with refernces to sufism/spirituality
- goes on to talk about the persistent survival of nature in competition with time
- we all have a seed of uniqueness that separates us from each other
- Traditional tuning standards based on nature
- He talks about how tuning standards have changed and he was made to observe it by an ustad who sang the same bar on different notes
- "If a plant is happy in a space, you’ll be happy in that space."
- He can no longer listen to popular rock because the “off-tuned” nature is too vivid to his ears now
- While exploring mysticism, scriptures, he found that there were more feminine attributes (? Ok???)
- Feminine is the thinker, masculine is the doer x feminine “needs” the masculine to do anything — okay cool (y)
- ~ low of resonance ~ GOONJ!
🧠 ramblings- Talks about a balance of things - everything has 3 parts that cause a resonance between them
- “The randomness in music has healing properties for our soul”
- The world is not a place for the mind that locks itself in a room, in solitude to explore frequencies, souls, nature, mysticism
- Told musicians at coke studio, to skip the notes/give space to the singer who was on a traditional scale. Perfectly working with the traditional x modern OR eastern x western
- “nature is anti-monopoly” // there is redundancy in the system
- If machines were tuned to sound better, if businesses learnt from nature and natural systems, our brains wouldn’t be rattled by the sounds/feelings around us
