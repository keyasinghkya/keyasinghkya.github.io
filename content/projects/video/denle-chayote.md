This work is an attempt to delve into the complexities of identity, culture, and human connection while drawing inspiration from the narrative styles of TV and YouTube shows. Through the humanised character of a chayote, I explore themes of post-colonialism and cultural exchange, primarily inspired by my experiences in Oaxaca, Mexico. With a blend of humour and introspection, the viewer is invited to join me on a personal journey of exchange, fostering a deeper understanding of the shared human experience.
