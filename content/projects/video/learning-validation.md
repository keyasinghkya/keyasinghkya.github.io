Self-reflection comes through even more clearly often with the help of others. When you work with people who see you as someone who’s more than a colleague, the work becomes easier and arguably better. My work with video so far has allowed me to meet and interact with wonderful people who continue to support me and help me grow as an artist. This work is about them teaching me validation while simultaneously being a portrait of each of them.
