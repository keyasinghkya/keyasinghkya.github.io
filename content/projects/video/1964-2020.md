Growing up, I watched my father dance to Ishq Tera Tadpave with such joy that it was infectious. I started mimicking his moves, and it soon became our song. It also became the song I could dance to without worrying about how I look or if people were looking at me funny. Inadvertently our dance routine helped my self-esteem/image.

He passed away in April that year. Not being able to be there for him before and not being able to see him when it happened has left me with an incredible amount of trauma and guilt. It has made it hard for me to create and work this year. But I remembered something I learnt from him - how to appreciate my life and be passionate about the people around me. This work and my actions since his passing are all attempts to externalise my memories of him.

I first made *1964_2020* in May-June of 2020 during an online workshop on [the Creative and Artistic Use of Medical Imagery](/projects/neither/jpeg2dicom) led by Icelandic artist, Haraldur Karlsson and organised by Vašulka Kitchen Brno (Brno, Czech Republic). Using an MRI viewer, I compressed the original music video into 3D imagery.

This version of the original was on display during [Plot Twist](https://www.instagram.com/p/CInhuLgFP9w/) at Method Bandra (18th December 2020 to 7th January 2021).
