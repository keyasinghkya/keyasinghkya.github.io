An audiovisual presentation of research I did while writing an essay about Global Groove (1973) by Nam June Paik. At that moment in time, this was the most extensively researched and planned video project I had worked on. The writing and planning process prepared me for future projects. The audiovisual language of this video was inspired by Nam June Paik's work – specifically his editing patterns and vibrant use of colours reflecting the contemporary trends in broadcast television and advertisements.
