I was asked to create a video using curated archive footage by Matyaš Dlab (dramaturg) and Lucia Repasska (director) of D'epog. This work was made in collaboration with a Ukrainian artist, John Object.

The idea was to play with the infectious, chaotic energy that D'epog exudes. I decided to build the narrative around an understated metaphor of screens as an observation of self while slowing and stretching time.

We also made a second video that remains unlisted/unselected:
