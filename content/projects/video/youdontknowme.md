An attempt to confront the outer world with all the faces my inner world can put on while exclaiming the words “You Don’t Know Me” over and over again with varying stress on each word. The rhythm of the video was inspired while exploring the works of Gary Hill.

This work was exhibited at Galerie Města Pardubice (8th to 10th June 2018) as part of a group exhibition titled “I dropped my phone yesterday”.

It was later adapted for a performance, "Blind Date", as part of a series of exhibits under the title "Phenomenological Recipes", curated by Cristina Maldonado at 4+4 Days in Motion 2018 (Prague, Czech Republic).
