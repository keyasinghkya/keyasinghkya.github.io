A (hyper)realistic representation of what it would be like to party with myself with an audiovisual performance by me for me. This work was inspired by strong, vibrant female pop musicians I witnessed while growing up who imbibed a need in me to find a self-image.

- Audio: live coded and recorded on Sonic Pi
- Background visuals: iTunes Classic Visualiser
- Filmed on a Canon 70D
- Edited on Adobe Premiere Pro CC
