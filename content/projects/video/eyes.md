**by keya singh and ioanna loup**  
the body provides us a sensual experience of itself, others and the world. in return, it demands care and concern – often requiring professional intervention. with its roots in mark fisher’s texts about “the eerie”, this film explores such interventions with a focus on ophthalmology and one patient’s inner voice during those interventions. the eerie is the failure of presence and the failure of absence. and our eyes contribute to these failures.
