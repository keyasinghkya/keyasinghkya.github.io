All my life, I have been hearing others (and myself) constantly comment on my appearance. This work is about being stuck in a loop of choreographed movements that are mainly done to observe my own image while contemplating the hollowness of my actions and being.

This work was on display at Černý bávo > bílej boomer in Pardubice, Czech Republic from 14th April to 6th June 2021. ![](/images/naqes-pardubice.png)

And in April of 2022, this work was exhibited as part of "Fresh Produce" by Method India at India Art Fair along with 2 other video works – [You Don't Know Me, 2018](/projects/video/youdontknowme) and [PRTY FR 1, 2019](/projects/video/prtyfr1).
