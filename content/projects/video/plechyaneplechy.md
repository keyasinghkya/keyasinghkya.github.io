While interning at Teren in 2020, I filmed and edited a series of videos for a sound performance produced at Centrum Experimentálního Divadla (CED) Brno. This event featured performances by Petr Válek, Ondřej Merta, and Marie Komarová, and was organized in cooperation with [Vašulka Kitchen Brno](https://vasulkakitchen.org/) and [Bastl Instruments](https://bastl-instruments.com).

The video documentation captured the process of sound production by the three artists, showcasing their use of various materials in different compositions. These ranged from solitary sounds to complex, multilayered ones, allowing for diverse interpretations. Out of the videos I created, only one (a summary of the event) is available for viewing on Teren's Vimeo channel, while the rest were made for their internal archive.
