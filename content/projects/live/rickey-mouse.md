Rickey Mouse Fun House was a project led by Finnish artist, Pasi Mäkelä. I initially joined this constellation in the role of support camera and video editor during their first performance which was [live streamed from Punctum](https://youtu.be/3J7kacIyDzE) (Prague, CZ) in December 2020. From the following year, I began creating the live-visuals we would use in the show. Spiritually and formally rooted in experiment and play, this project was genuinely *fun* to be a part of. I was able to come in and develop all the live-camera things I wanted to play with, while also learning how these phenomenal musicians improvised together using specific counting systems and timing to enhance the audience's listening experience as well as their own experiences of playing live music. I developed my practise of working with the simplicity of OBS Studio and pushing its limits by building visuals using chroma/luma keying, layering, collaging, screen inputs, source repetition, multiple camera inputs and multiple projections.

### 2023
*"We can expect vibrant cross-genre music and strange acts forming the event horizon of critical culture and an orgasmic artistic experience saturated with dark light. In the fourth and final edition of Rickey Mouse Fun House, we will, among other things, become acquainted with various approaches to mouse music, from classical and contemporary to wild forms of free experimental cheese music and poetry. The performance has no language or intellectual barrier (some parts are in English, but most are in a made-up language)."*

### 2022
*“Our multinational group brings you the third edition of RMFH, this time we meet the already deceased Cat Communistic leader Maow and enjoy his honorary memorial show played to you by Rickey Mouse and his All-Mouse House band. We celebrate the death of open politics and embrace the flow of the surrounding obscure contemporary nightmare with eyes crossed and tongue in the cheek.”*

### 2021
*"This time RMFH brings you a political entertainment rally for Maow The Cat, leader of new era individual cat communism. Twitched and genre-free music, strange and instructive performance numbers form an event horizon of culture critical and an orgasmic art experience saturated with dark light. Rickey Mouse Fun House is juggling with political correctness, traveling beyond the boundaries of good taste and revitalizing the ancient art of the Underground."*
