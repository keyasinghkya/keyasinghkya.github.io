LyrArkestra+ was a collaborative project within which I created visuals along with [Cristina](https://cristinamaldonado.com) and [Isa](https://isajuchniewicz.com).

The project focused on performing graphic scores primarily by Czech and Slovak composers in unconventional audiovisual renditions. The international ensemble of this essentially fluid project does not have a permanent team. The audio composition were developed and performed by Tomáš Knoflíček (Gurun Gurun) from Ostrava, Michal Zbořil (IQ+1, B4) from Přerov, Daniel Jakeš (Jasnovidec, Koroze) from High Tatras, Ken Ganfield (PIO, The MoND) from Ames, Martin Nábělek (Boyse) from Banská Bystrica, and Petr Vrba (Poisonous Frequencies, Banausoi) from Prague. All sounds originated in the Lyra synthesizer, which is described as "organismic", i.e. close to living organisms in its internal interactions and functioning on the basis of imaginary "conversations" between the individual modules...The musical component is complemented by the visuals of Cristina Maldonado, Keya Singh and Isa Juchniewicz, who has created a structured digital environment that both responds directly to the music and allows for an additional layer of improvisation.

### 2024
01.06 in Ovalhalle im Museumsquartier for Vienna Shorts 2024\
We performed a composition that combined interpretations of both Steklík and Adamčiak. No documentation, unfortunately (｡•́︿•̀｡).

### 2023
*“The performance LyrArkestra+ Jan Steklík was created in collaboration with Terén and the Brno House of Arts, an institution with a long-term focus on the presentation of Steklík’s works. In 2018, the Brno House of Arts curated a retrospective exhibition presenting Jan Steklík as one of the prominent Czech artists of the second half of the 20th century. ”*

### 2022
*In its first edition, we looked at the graphic scores of Milan Adamčiak (1946-2017). He  was a Slovak composer, cellist and musicologist; author of acoustic objects, installations and unconventional musical instruments; performer, visual artist, experimental poet, and mystifier. Our visual interpretation used references to performance art history and the 2022 film, Fire of Love – both reflecting elements found in Adamčiak's scores as well as his other visual and performance work*
