"Zangezi is a sextet accompanied by a “visual artist" and a "sound designer" that strives for an artificial but organic sound production aesthetic." As the visual artist in this sextet, I composed the live-visuals in this piece along with camera support from Hoi Man. Much of the visuals were created with live-camera input along with elements made using footage filmed the day before during our rehearsals. In this work, the visuals mainly played with temporality and multiplicity of the image.

"The concert is structured around three main themes that provide points of reference for its development: the reflections surrounding the concepts of generations and identities; the idea of disconnection, misunderstanding and incongruity through the exploration of language and its appropriation or misappropriation; and the escapist journey towards an ideal other place."<br>
