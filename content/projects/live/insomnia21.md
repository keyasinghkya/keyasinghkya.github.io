I was invited to create visuals for 3 sets back-to-back for Insomnia Festival's kick-off event at Storgata Camping (Tromsø, Norway). The first two sets lasted about 1 hour each while the last one was 3 hours long.
So far the longest set I have made, this was a great opportunity to see how far I can go with maintaining a sense of live-ness and control even when the material feels like it has already been exhausted.
