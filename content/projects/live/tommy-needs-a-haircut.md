A series of ongoing live works centred on the world of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. This work began in March 2024 as a playful revisitation of a nostalgic game from my childhood. I employ the protagonist, Tommy, as the actor on my stage who performs in ways that are often more sensual than originally written in the game. By doing so, I amplify the complexities of human behaviour and social dynamics within the game environment as they reflect real-world ethical dilemmas fuelled with existentialism. Inspired by Lev Manovich's notions of media remixability, I am interested in remixing not just aesthetics but also techniques, methods, and languages of different media. For the future of this project, I want to get into subtle alterations of the game world itself.

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City’s Tommy Vercetti stars in this work as a man on yet another mission, but this time, it is self-assigned. Experience the gradual awakening of his existence as he blends humour, absurdity, rage, and introspection on his journey of self/other/world-discovery. Who wouldn’t feel a bit lost, a little angry, and profoundly emotional upon realising they are, in fact, a video game character?

In this live A/V performance, we playfully attempt to relive our childhood memories of being absorbed by the world of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Through our real-time visual and aural interventions, we expose and reflect on our own exhausted and somewhat-nihilistic sense of reality. Our protagonist, Tommy is caught in loops of choices and consequences.

<h3 id="collab">*made in collaboration with lizwiz </h3>

lizwiz and I brought our respective practices in audio and visuals into this project. In the project, she worked with mixing audio using a DJ controller and a computer — the audio includes curated music and game sounds performed with the intention of live-soundtracking. While I played the game on MacOS, sending its audio out and mixing visually on a PC with graphics through OBS. We worked closely on writing the monologue and narrative while also self-producing the performative aspects of each version
