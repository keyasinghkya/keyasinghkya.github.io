## Sherry Turkle: Alone Together

notes:
- starts with talking about how her perspective towards tech changed as tech changed
- we are eternally attached to technology/online/connected
- pet scans that reflect how people's brains react to technology
- talking about affordances and vulnerability / and not addiction
affordances = the quality or property of an object that defines its possible uses or makes clear how it can or should be used.
- "waiting to put each other on pause"
- we are lonely but afraid of intimacy
- the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship
~~ we can't get enough of each other if we can have each other but at a distance and in amounts that we can control
- "we'd rather text than talk"

what are the costs of technology?
1. allows us distraction from what we care about:
- too busy communicating to think
- too busy communicating to create
- too busy communicating with the people who matter

2. we can communicate when we wish and we can disengage at will
ref chapter: please do not call

- we live a life of performance / online manufactured selves
- being anxious about how to disengage from a person during a phone call **
overwhelmed across generations
- professional/personal the details change but the dynamics remain the same
- we measure our success through contacts reached
- we have created a communication system:
- that has reduced our time to sit and think uninterrupted
- that asks for almost instantaneous responses

- the value of back and forth in conversations is that it expresses respect for the complexity of people, of human emotions, of what we need to say to each other
- lol Winston Churchill reference / fuck that guy
- "I share therefore I am"
- "I want to have a feeling" --> "I need to send a text"
- contact lists have become spare parts to support the self
- reduction of people into tools of validation
- inner directed selves to other directed selves
- in this constant online way of living, what is not being cultivated is the ability to be alone and to gather oneself

the metaphor of addiction:
- the little notification says you are wanted
- we can ill afford this metaphor
- it subverts our best thinking because it demands ONE solution = to get rid of it / the solution that we are not going to take
- this makes us feel hopeless and passive
- we are not passive victims of a bad substance
- in our use of technology we have incurred some costs that we don't want to pay
- we are in trouble not because of invention, but because we sometimes allow ourselves to think invention will solve everything
- we will not find 1 solution or a simple answer
- moving forward, repair

our moment of opportunity
- does it serve our human purposes? what are these purposes?
- just because we grew up with the internet, we assume that the internet is all grown up

q/a:
1/ empirical evidence on the increase of multitasking as impacted by technology
- dopamine rush from each task added / as the performance declines

2/ does the premise undermine a kind of look back to an imagined past that was better?
- what grounds her is a notion of presence and attention to each other

3/ global view on this topic
- her study is a study of the US
- other cultures have different ways of thinking about the norm
- sociable robots scare her

4/ "what about the arab spring" question (what are some positives of technology)
- thumbs up to bringing down dictatorships x thumbs down to texting at funerals
- organising politically socially personally 10/10
- we should be able to take the good and still say that there's some of it we don't want (ie privacy)


5/ reaction to steve job's death
- shows the impact of how technology has truly touched people
- he was saying lets design something gorgeous and make it something people want to have on their bodies
- "we are living his imagination"
